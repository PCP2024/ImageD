### Version 1.1.0 - 02.07.24
- Added `remove_background` function to the image processing module.
- The `remove_background` function utilizes advanced algorithms from the `rembg` library 
to accurately remove the background from images.
- It takes an input image and returns the image with the background removed.
- This function is a crucial addition to the image processing capabilities of the application.
- GUI & CMD for works with `remove_background`


### Version 1.0.0 - 11.06.24
